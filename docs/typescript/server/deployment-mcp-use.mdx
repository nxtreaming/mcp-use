description: Deploy your MCP server to mcp-use cloud with one command
---

Deploy your MCP server to **mcp-use cloud**, the recommended deployment platform for mcp-use servers. With a single command, you can deploy your server and get a production-ready URL.

## Prerequisites
**mcp-use Account**: Sign up at [mcp-use.com](https://mcp-use.com) or login via CLI

## Quick Deployment

Deploy your MCP server in one command:

```bash
# Install the CLI (if you are using create-mcp-use-app this step is not needed)
npm install -g @mcp-use/cli

# Login to mcp-use cloud
yarn run mcp-use login

# Deploy your server
yarn run mcp-use deploy
```

That's it! Your server will be built and deployed automatically.

## GitHub Repository Deployment

If your project is a GitHub repository, `mcp-use deploy` will automatically detect it and offer to deploy from GitHub:

```bash
mcp-use deploy
```

You'll see:
```
GitHub repository detected:
  Repository: your-org/your-repo
  Branch:     main
  Commit:     abc1234

Deploy from GitHub repository your-org/your-repo? (y/n):
```

This approach:
- ✅ Deploys directly from your GitHub repository
- ✅ Automatically detects build and start commands
- ✅ Uses the latest commit from your branch
- ✅ No need to upload source code manually

### Example Project Structure

```
my-mcp-server/
├── package.json          # Detects build/start commands
├── src/
│   └── index.ts         # Server entry point
├── resources/           # UI widgets (auto-registered)
│   └── weather.tsx
└── dist/               # Build output (excluded from upload)
```

## After Deployment

Once deployment completes, you'll receive:

### Deployment URLs

```
✓ Deployment successful!

🌐 MCP Server URL:
   https://your-deployment-id.deploy.mcp-use.com/mcp

🔍 Inspector URL:
   https://inspector.mcp-use.com/inspect?autoConnect=https://your-deployment-id.deploy.mcp-use.com/mcp
```

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "url": "https://your-deployment-id.deploy.mcp-use.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```


### Test Locally First

Before deploying, test your server locally:

```bash
# Build and test locally
mcp-use build
mcp-use start
```
