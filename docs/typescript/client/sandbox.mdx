Sandbox execution provides a secure, isolated cloud environment for running MCP servers. This allows you to execute servers without installing dependencies locally and provides enhanced security for untrusted code.

<Warning>
**TypeScript Support Coming Soon**

Sandbox execution is currently only available in the Python version of mcp-use. TypeScript support is planned for a future release.

For now, please use the [Python Sandbox documentation](/python/client/sandbox) if you need this functionality.
</Warning>

## What is Sandbox Execution?

Sandbox execution runs MCP servers in isolated cloud environments, providing:

- **Security**: Execute untrusted code safely
- **Isolation**: No access to your local file system or network
- **Clean environment**: Fresh execution context for each run
- **No local dependencies**: Servers run remotely with their own dependencies

## Benefits

### Security

Running servers in a sandbox protects your local system from potentially malicious code or unintended side effects.

### Portability

No need to install server dependencies locally. The sandbox environment provides everything needed.

### Consistency

Each execution starts with a clean slate, ensuring reproducible results.

## Current Status

Sandbox functionality is currently available in:

- **Python**: Full support via E2B integration
- **TypeScript**: Planned for future release

## Next Steps

- **Python Users**: See the [Python Sandbox Guide](/python/client/sandbox) for implementation details
- **TypeScript Users**: [Track progress on GitHub](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use) or request the feature
