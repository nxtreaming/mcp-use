The MCP Inspector provides comprehensive RPC logging capabilities that allow you to monitor all [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) messages exchanged between the inspector and your MCP servers in real-time. This feature is essential for debugging, understanding server behavior, and troubleshooting connection issues.

### What is RPC Logging?

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) logging captures every [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) message sent to and received from MCP servers. This includes:

- **Tool calls**: Requests to execute tools and their responses
- **Resource requests**: Queries for resources and their results
- **Prompt requests**: Prompt execution requests and responses
- **Notifications**: Server-initiated notifications
- **Errors**: Error responses and connection issues

## Understanding the Interface

### Message List

Each RPC message is displayed as a row with:

- **Timestamp**: Local time when the message was received
- **Direction Badge**: 
  - <span className="inline-flex items-center px-1 py-0.5 rounded bg-green-500/10 text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">↑ SEND</span> - Outgoing messages from inspector to server
  - <span className="inline-flex items-center px-1 py-0.5 rounded bg-blue-500/10 text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">↓ RECEIVE</span> - Incoming messages from server to inspector
- **Method Name**: The JSON-RPC method being called (e.g., `tools/call`, `resources/read`)
- **Expandable Content**: Click to view the full JSON payload

## Technical Details

### Message Format

Each logged message contains:

```typescript
{
  id: string;              // Unique message ID
  serverId: string;        // Server identifier
  direction: "SEND" | "RECEIVE";
  method: string;          // JSON-RPC method name
  timestamp: string;       // ISO timestamp
  payload: unknown;        // Full JSON-RPC payload
