# Getting Started

## Dashboard

The MCP Inspector dashboard is your central hub for managing MCP server connections.

![Dashboard](/images/inspector/dashboard.png)

What you see:
- Connected Servers panel (left)
- Connect panel with transport, URL, connection type, auth, headers (right)
- Quick actions in the top bar

Next: add the Linear MCP server to begin a live walkthrough.

### Add MCP Server

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Connect Panel">
Open the Connect panel on the right side of the dashboard.

![Connect Form](/images/inspector/connect-form.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Transport">
Set Transport Type to "Streamable HTTP" for SSE connections.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Server URL">
Enter the MCP server URL (e.g., `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`).
</Step>

<Step title="Connect">
Click the Connect button to establish the connection.
</Step>
</Steps>

### OAuth Authentication

<Note>
All authentication tokens and credentials are stored securely in your browser's local storage. Nothing is sent to our servers - everything stays on your device.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Authorization Request">
Servers like Linear require OAuth. After clicking Connect, you'll see the authorization page.

![OAuth Linear](/images/inspector/oauth-linear.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Grant Access">
Click "Approve" to grant access. The inspector handles the redirect automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Connected Server

Once authenticated, the server appears in the Connected Servers list with a green indicator.

![Server Connected](/images/inspector/server-connected.png)

### Tools Tab

The Tools tab displays all available tools from the MCP server. Each tool shows its name and description.

<img src="/images/inspector/tools-list.png" alt="Tools tab interface showing list of available tools" />
</Frame>

Select a tool to view its details and execute it. The right panel will show the tool's schema and an Execute button.

### Resources Tab

The Resources tab displays available resources from the MCP server. Resources are data sources the server can provide.

<Frame caption="Resources tab showing no resources available">
<img src="/images/inspector/resources-empty.png" alt="Resources tab interface showing empty state" />
</Frame>

Note: Linear MCP server doesn't expose any resources, so this tab shows "No resources available".

### Prompts Tab

The Prompts tab shows pre-configured prompts from the MCP server. You can select and execute prompts with parameters.

<Frame caption="Prompts tab showing no prompts available">
<img src="/images/inspector/prompts-empty.png" alt="Prompts tab interface showing empty state" />
</Frame>

Note: Linear MCP server doesn't provide any prompts, so this tab shows "No prompts available".

# Chat Tab

<Note>
The Chat feature uses a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model. Your API key is stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers. All requests are made directly from your device to your LLM provider.
</Note>

The Chat tab provides an interactive interface to test the MCP server with an LLM. Configure your API key to start chatting.


### Chat Setup
To use the chat:

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure API Key">
Click "Configure API Key" to open the configuration modal.
