<Info>
The mcp-use server framework is built on top of the official [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk). This ensures full compatibility with existing MCP clients and tools that adhere to the Model Context Protocol. mcp-use extends the SDK's core functionality, providing enhanced features without introducing breaking changes.
</Info>

## Zero Breaking Changes

mcp-use extends the official MCP Python SDK rather than replacing it, ensuring:

- **All existing MCP clients work out of the box**
- **Full protocol compliance** with MCP specifications
- **Easy migration** from existing MCP servers
- **Enhanced features** without breaking existing functionality

## Compatibility Matrix

| Feature | FastMCP | mcp-use | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| MCP Protocol | ✅ | ✅ | Full compliance |
| Tools | ✅ | ✅ | Same decorator API |
| Resources | ✅ | ✅ | Same decorator API |
| Prompts | ✅ | ✅ | Same decorator API |
| Documentation | ❌ | ✅ | Built-in docs UI |
| Inspector UI | ❌ | ✅ | Real-time monitoring |
| Enhanced Logging | ❌ | ✅ | MCP method logging |
| Much more to come... | ❌ | ✅ | Continuous enhancements |

## Migration Guide

### From FastMCP

If you have an existing MCP server built with FastMCP, migration is as simple as changing the import:

#### Migrating
It literally cannot be easier to migrate from FastMCP to mcp-use. You just need to add `_use` to your import.
```python
from mcp.server import FastMCP #[!code --]
from mcp_use.server import FastMCP #[!code ++]

mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", port=8000)
```

**That's it!** Just change the import and you get all the enhanced features:
- Built-in inspector UI at `/inspector`
- Enhanced logging with MCP method information
- Documentation at `/docs`
- OpenMCP configuration at `/openmcp.json`
- Configurable paths for all endpoints

### Key Improvements

1. **Drop-in Replacement**: Same FastMCP API with enhanced features
2. **Built-in Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger docs at `/docs`
3. **Inspector UI**: Real-time monitoring and testing at `/inspector`
4. **Enhanced Logging**: MCP method information in structured logs
5. **Configurable Paths**: Customize all endpoint paths
6. **Much More Coming**: Continuous feature additions

## Protocol Compliance

mcp-use maintains full compliance with the MCP protocol specifications:

- **Tool Discovery**: Implements `tools/list` and `tools/call` endpoints
- **Resource Management**: Implements `resources/list` and `resources/read` endpoints
- **Prompt Templates**: Implements `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses with MCP-compliant error codes
- **Session Management**: Full support for MCP session lifecycle

## Client Compatibility

All MCP clients that work with the official SDK will work with mcp-use servers:

- **Claude Desktop**: Full compatibility
- **ChatGPT**: Full compatibility
- **Custom MCP Clients**: Full compatibility
- **mcp-use Client**: Enhanced compatibility with additional features

## Testing Compatibility

You can test your mcp-use server with any MCP client:

```bash
# Test with mcp-use client
from mcp_use.client import MCPClient

config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "my-server": {
            "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
        }
    }
}

client = MCPClient(config)
session = await client.create_session("my-server")

# List tools
tools = await session.list_tools()
print("Available tools:", [tool.name for tool in tools])

# Call a tool
result = await session.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
print("Result:", result)
```

## Best Practices

### Maintaining Compatibility

1. **Use Type Hints**: Always use proper type hints for automatic schema generation
2. **Follow MCP Conventions**: Use descriptive tool names and clear documentation
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Return proper error responses for invalid inputs
4. **Test with Multiple Clients**: Verify compatibility with different MCP clients

### Leveraging mcp-use Features

1. **Use Decorators**: Take advantage of the simplified decorator-based API
2. **Enable Documentation**: Use the built-in OpenAPI documentation
3. **Monitor with Inspector**: Use the inspector UI for debugging and monitoring
4. **Structured Logging**: Use JSON logging for better observability
