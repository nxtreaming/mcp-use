# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## ⚠️ Important: Automated Workflows

**Versioning and publishing are handled automatically by GitHub Actions workflows.**

- ✅ **You should**: Create changesets for your changes
- ❌ **Don't manually run**: `pnpm version` or `pnpm release`

### How It Works

#### Main Branch (Stable Releases)

1. Create a changeset with `pnpm changeset`
2. Push to main (via PR)
3. CI automatically creates a "Version Packages" PR
4. Merge the Version PR to publish stable versions

#### Canary Branch (Prereleases)

1. Create a changeset with `pnpm changeset`
2. Push to canary branch
3. CI automatically publishes as `x.y.z-canary.N`

## Quick Start

### Creating a Changeset (Required for Contributors)

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select which packages have changes
2. Choose the version bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

**Then commit and push the changeset file with your changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push
```

### ~~Applying Changesets (Versioning)~~ (Automated by CI)

~~`pnpm version`~~ **⚠️ This is handled automatically by workflows. Do not run manually.**

### ~~Publishing to npm~~ (Automated by CI)

~~`pnpm release`~~ **⚠️ This is handled automatically by workflows. Do not run manually.**
